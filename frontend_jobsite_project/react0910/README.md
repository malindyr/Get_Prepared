# **React Job Site**

## **Project Description**

React Job Site is a mock job board application built using React. This project was designed to practice React concepts like routing, state management, and form handling. It also uses a mock API for fetching, adding, and updating job data.

## **Why This Project**

The motivation behind this project was to get comfortable with React before diving into more complex applications like my Pokémon Pearl Pokédex project. Building this, helped me understand the basic structure of a React app, routing with React Router, and integrating a mock API.
By building this project, working with a mock API allowed me to simulate real-world API interactions, preparing me for future React-projects.

## **Features**

- **Home Page**: Displays basic information about the site.

- **Jobs Listing**: View all available jobs. This page retrieves the job data from the mock API.

- **Job Details Page**: Information for a specific job, including title, description, salary, and location.

- **Add Job Page**: Form to add a new job. The form submission is handled via POST requests to the mock API.

- **Edit Job Page**: For updating existing job postings using a form. The changes are made through PUT requests to the mock API.

- **Delete Job**: Jobs can also be deleted from the listing, handled via DELETE requests.

- **Error Handling**: Displays a custom 404 page for invalid URLs.


Some challenges I encountered included managing form state and properly handling the various HTTP methods for CRUD operations. I also encountered challenges with css.
  

## **What I Learned**

- **React Router**: Gained experience setting up routes with **react-router-dom** for navigating between pages.
- **State and Form Handling**: Managed form input for creating and updating jobs using React’s state.
- **Mock API**: Utilized a mock REST API to simulate CRUD operations on job data.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Created reusable components.
- **HTTP Methods in React**: Worked with **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, and **DELETE** methods to communicate with the mock API.

## **Technologies Used**

- **React + vite**: Library for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **React Router DOM**: For managing navigation and routing within the app.
- **Mock REST API**: Simulated backend for job data manipulation.
- **npm run server**: To run the mock API for simulating backend requests.
- **tailwind**: For styling of components.
